Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task. Transfer learning is the improvement of learning in a new task through the transfer of knowledge from a related task that has already been learned.

The task focuses on using a pre-trained model to create another model by adding more dense layers for detection of a new object. We need to import the pretrained model that we want to use. It can be MobieNet, VGG16, VGG19 Inception. In this model I used ResNset50 as a pre-trained model and RMSprop as the optimizer.
